１．背景要因：＜患者＞・患者は川崎病のため、十数年前から当該医療機関に入退院を繰り返しており、外来へは月１回〜３ヶ月に１回通院していた。・患者はＰＣＩ目的の入院だったため成人の循環器病棟へ入院することも可能であったが、これまでの疾患の経過や年齢を考慮し、循環器病棟ではなく小児循環器病棟へ入院することになった。・本来入院は午前中であるが、患者は、通常の入院時間より遅い１６時に入院した。・患者の母親は、過去の入院において内服薬を改めて処方されていたので、当該医療機関の外来で処方されている内服薬は持参しなくても良いと思い持参しなかった。＜医師＞・外来担当医師は、小児循環器内科の川崎病専門医（上級医師）、入院後の担当医は、小児循環器内科１０年目の　医師（レジデント）であった。入院中は、上級医（以下、医師Ａ）とレジデント（以下、医師Ｂ）の２名の診療体制をとっている。・ＰＣＩは、循環器内科（専門医）の医師（以下、医師Ｃ）が行った。・医師Ｂは、患者の入院時に電子カルテの「オーダフロー画面」から外来で処方されている薬を把握した（この画面は『処方歴』が分かるだけで、内服状況は確認できない画面であった）。医師Ｂは、外来で抗凝固薬が９０日分処方されていたため、患者が抗凝固薬を持参すると思っており、入院後に抗凝固薬の処方はしなかった。・医師Ｂは、病棟の担当薬剤師に「アスピリンを持参していない」と言われたが、ＰＣＩ前日のため、アスピリンは飲まなくても良かったため、「当日は飲まなくても良い」ということと混同し、「カテ前だからいいです」と返答した。・医師Ｂは、看護師から他院で処方されたアレルギー薬のみ持参していると聞いた際、「アレルギー薬は飲まなくて良い」と伝えた。・医師Ｂは、ＰＣＩに関連した前投薬などの指示は入力したが、持参薬の指示入力はしていない。しかし、患者にアスピリンが投与されているものと思い込んでいた。・ＰＣＩ当日（入院翌日）、医師Ａは医師Ｂに「朝のアスピリンは内服して」とＰＣＩ前に抗凝固薬の内服を指示した。・医師Ｂはアスピリンの内服指示のつもりで、看護師Ｅに「薬、飲ませて」と口頭で指示した。・医師Ｃは、循環器病棟では当たり前に内服している薬剤のため、当然、患者はアスピリンを内服していると思っていた。・院内では、医師は指示を出す場合、緊急時などを除いて、口頭で指示を出すことはしていなかった。＜薬剤師＞・当時、小児循環器病棟に担当の薬剤師はいたが、常駐の薬剤師は配置しておらず、病棟の看護師が「入院患者持参薬預り表」に持参薬の有無を○×で記載したものを見て、情報を得る仕組みになっていた。・病棟担当の薬剤師は、入院予定の患者情報から抗凝固薬（アスピリン）を内服していることを把握していたが、入院後、持参薬の報告がないため看護師Ｄに確認したところ、持参薬は無いと返答があった。・薬剤師は、医師Ｂに患者がアスピリンを持参していないことを伝えたが「ＰＣＩ前日だからいらない」と返答があり、直接患者や家族にも確認しなかった。＜看護師＞・患者の入院時に担当した看護師Ｄは、３年目の看護師であった。患者の入院時間が１６時と遅かったため、患者の把握が不十分になった可能性があった。・入院前、看護師Ｄは前回までの入院についての退院サマリ（経過記録）から患者の情報を得たが、サマリにはアスピリンなどの薬剤情報が記載されていなかった。外来で処方された薬剤を「オーダフロー画面」で確認することは出来たが、この時は確認しなかった。・入院時、看護師Ｄは患者の母親に持参薬を確認したところ、アレルギー薬のみ持参しており、普段からあまり飲んでいないと聞いた。・看護師Ｄは、医師Bへアレルギー薬の内服継続の有無について確認すると、「飲まなくてよい」と返答があった。そのため、持参薬が無くなったが薬剤師に持参薬について報告しなかった。・看護師Ｄは、患者のサマリから川崎病で瘤があることは分かっていたが、過去にワーファリンを内服して副作用があり服用を止めたことが記載されていたため、内服薬がないことを不思議に思わなかった。・翌日（ＰＣＩ当日）、看護師Ｅは、医師Ｂから「薬、飲ませて」と口頭で指示を受けたが、看護師Ｅは指示にあった前投薬のラボナを飲ませる意味だと思った。・医療機関内では通常業務において、口頭による指示は受けておらず、看護師は電子カルテ上でオーダを確認したうえで実施することになっていた。緊急時などの場合に口頭で指示を受けた場合は、経過記録に口頭指示を受けた内容と「オーダは後で入力」の旨を記載することになっていた。＜電子カルテシステム＞・電子カルテは２０１２年３月に導入した。それまではオーダリングシステムだけであった。・処方オーダ履歴が表示される「オーダフロー画面」は、患者の処方履歴がすべて一括表示される。また「オーダ履歴」画面では処方箋が発行されると「実施済」と表示される。外来処方日数が終了しないうちに入院すると処方オーダ履歴には入院中でも「実施済」と表示されるため、当該患者の「オーダフロー画面」には外来で処方された９０日分の薬剤が「実施済」と表示されていた。・患者の服用履歴を確認する場合は、「実施入力画面（実施サマリ画面）」を参照する。しかし、「実施入力画面」も外来、入院の処方履歴が反映されるため、処方されている薬が多いと画面表示に数十秒の時間がかかり、医師の活用頻度は低かった。・「実施入力画面」の服用履歴は、患者に配薬した時点または内服した時点で看護師が実施入力を行うことになっている。＜病院・病棟＞・入院当日、患者は総合入院センターに行き、その後各病棟へ入院する。総合入院センターは、多い時に１日５０名の入院があり、看護師４〜５名で対応している。総合入院センターでは持参薬の確認は行っていない。・小児科循環器病棟において、川崎病でＰＴＣＲＡを行なうのは年間１〜２例程度であった。そのため、川崎病のＰＣＩに対してクリティカルパスを活用していなかった。・成人が入院する循環器内科病棟には、ＰＣＩのクリティカルパスが導入されていることから、患者が循環器内科に入院していたら、今回の事象は止められた可能性がある。","既設の医療安全に関する委員会等で対応","","持参薬の有無の確認を、薬剤師が実施するよう体制を整える。ロータブレーダー後には、血栓性閉塞がおきやすいので、医師は抗凝固薬が投与されているかを確認する。電子カルテの指示画面等についても、必要な情報を得られるようにシステム変更を検討する。
・病棟と薬剤部で検討し、別の病棟を担当する薬剤師が当該病棟の担当薬剤師をバックアップし、常駐薬剤師と同じく患者が持参薬を持っているかどうか直接面談して情報を得ることにした。・入院時の持参薬管理は、看護師を介入せず、薬剤師が持参薬の管理を行なうことにした。薬剤師は持参薬の有無に関わらず電子カルテへ持参薬について入力することにし、持参薬はあるが、持参されなかった薬についても取りこぼしがないように管理することとなった。・薬剤部で抗凝固剤などの中止や再開忘れがあった情報を収集し、検討することにしている。・処方薬剤数が多い患者では「実施入力画面」の表示に時間がかかるため、医療情報部から「実施入力画面」の画面表示のレスポンス改善の申し入れをメーカーに行なっているところである。・処方の服用確認方法を周知徹底するため、各部署に文書で「患者が処方薬を服用したか確認できるのは『実施入力画面』だけです。」と注意喚起を行なった。・総合入院センターで患者の持参薬を確認してから、病棟に入院することができるか検討したい。"
